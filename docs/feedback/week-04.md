# Meeting

#### Meeting Organization

Mark: Pass

Feedback: 
- Chair: stijn de Lange
- Minute taker: Yavor Pachedzhiev


#### Agenda 

Mark: Very Good

Feedback: Good agenda that follows the intended format. Try to agree on your minute taker before the meeting and put it in the agenda. 


#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker

Mark: Very Good

Feedback: Clear and elaborate notes. The only point of improvement would be the two points that state "Somebody (TBD who)" 


#### Chair performance

Mark: Sufficient

Feedback: Somewhat disorganized meeting, at some point there were two conversations at the same time. Wanted to close the meeting before agreements were made for the next week of work. 


#### Attitude & Relation

Mark: Good

Feedback: Overall atmosphere was constructive, but one or two members were pretty quiet during the meeting. 


#### Potentially Shippable Product

Mark: Excellent

Feedback: A lot of progress was made, there is even a database schema. Everything is merged into main. 


#### Work Contribution/Distribution in the Team

Mark: Very Good

Feedback: I got the feeling that everybody tries to do their part. If I remember correctly, there were some goals from last week that had not been met.
