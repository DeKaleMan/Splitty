# Minute taker notes
- Everyone completed the git assignment succesfully except Stijn but he is almost done
- The knockout criteria start this week so we need to make sure that everyone reaches 100 lines of code, 3 commits etc.
- Code of conduct
  - Almost finished content wise but still need to do the formatting
  - Couple of needed changes
    - The code style we agreed on in checkstyle
    - Testing policies we agreed on (basically test all non-trivial methods, non trivial methods include methods such as getters, setters etc.)
    - Add to development strategy that we only allow to push very small changes to main (such as variable renaming)
- Made a google agenda to keep track of when we agreed on meetings, deadlines etc.
- Agreed on a meeting on friday after the lecture to discuss how we are going to use issues, this meeting will also be used to divide the first couple of tasks because we want to wait for the 2 lectures this week before starting to code
- DO NOT squash commits during this project as it will make you fail the weekly requirements
