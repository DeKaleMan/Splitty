# Minute taker notes
- Everybody did fine with their assigned tasks. Additional note: a Transaction class was created for improving the process of calculating debts.
- This week we should write actual, useful code - based on the technical lectures this week. It's now about actual groundwork for the rest of the project.
- Deleting lines doesn't actually subtract lines from our knock-out criteria. What exactly constitutes a line in the knock-out criteria script will be explained in a Brightspace announcement. 
- Testing front-end - it can be done via an event trigger - it's advisable to ask how to do that in detail on answers.ewi
- Implementing user account system is not allowed, but we can still store some user data - such as an email.
- We can delete the Quote app - we can just look it up, if needed for inspiration, in the .zip file on Brightspace.
- We divided ourselves into 2 groups for this week

  - Front-end (Jesse, Julian, Joris) - creating all scenes, applying CSS, programming controllers for basic interaction between scenes (without interaction with ServerUtils yet)
  - Back-end (Maciej, Yavor, Stijn) - making the conceptual schema of the database, figuring out JPA and deciding what to do next with that knowledge (probably making initial queries) - meeting on Thursday

- Somebody (TBD who) can make a utility class for statistics
- Somebody (TBD who) can make the handling of the config file
- The admin functionality is postponed for the next week
- Jesse will finish the formatting of Code of Conduct and submit it after final consultation with the team. If any changes arise, we will submit it again.
- We meet on Friday during lunch break (already in the calendar)
- Before the meeting on Tuesday 5.03 both groups will update each other.
