**Ghost Participants**
We will briefly explain how the participant system works. When a user creates an event they are automatically the host. They can invite others through email and themselves with an invite code. Other users may join the event and can use all the functionality like creating expenses, settling debts and managing tags. There is ane thing only the host can do, which is creating/deleting/editing ghost participants. Ghost participants are participants created by the host, there are no users linked through the app to ghost participants. The idea is that if a user creates an event and wants to add a person without the app, they can simply add them as a ghost participant and fill in the details themselves. For every other functionality ghost participants work the same as other users.

**The HCI features**
Upon selected or when hovering over a button or item in a list the item or button will change colour so the user knows what they have selected. 
Anything related to colour such as the red and green buttons, or the tags have appropriate text fill. When the background colour is darker the text is white, and the other way around. 
We added icons at various places so the user finds certain features faster such as settings, admin and statistics.
The entire app is filled with error messages which could pop up and inform the user what they are doing wrong, these are always red so the user knows its an error. The same goes for confirmation messages and these are always blue.
Regarding expenses, undoing changes is possible for as far as the user made changes during their visit to the event. 

Shortcuts
In general: ESC mean to go back or to cancel. Enter on a selected item means to view or edit it. Double clicking also works.
In the startscreen: 'Ctrl Shft N' to create a new event.
In the settings: 'Ctrl s' to save settings
In admin overview: Clicking outside of the import text area makes it disappear again.
