**The HCI features**
Upon selected or when hovering over a button or item in a list the item or button will change colour so the user knows what they have selected. 
Anything related to colour such as the red and green buttons, or the tags have appropriate text fill. When the background colour is darker the text is white, and the other way around. 
We added icons at various places so the user finds certain features faster such as settings, admin and statistics.
The entire app is filled with error messages which could pop up and inform the user what they are doing wrong, these are always red so the user knows its an error. The same goes for confirmation messages and these are always blue.
Regarding expenses, undoing changes is possible for as far as the user made changes during their visit to the event. 

Shortcuts
In general: ESC mean to go back or to cancel. Enter on a selected item means to view or edit it. Double clicking also works.
In the startscreen: 'Ctrl Shft N' to create a new event.
In the settings: 'Ctrl s' to save settings
In admin overview: Clicking outside of the import text area makes it disappear again.
